# EvoPyramid-AI

EvoPyramid-AI is an evolving research playground for experimenting with EVO
concepts, PEAR processors, and related ecosystem tooling. This repository now
includes the foundational community and automation scaffolding required to grow
safely.

üîó **EvoPyramid AI Repository:** [evopyramidai](https://github.com/AleeexTk/evopyramid-ai)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd evopyramid-ai
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install project dependencies once dependency files are published.
3. Run the default quality gates:
   ```bash
   ruff check .
   pytest
   ```

## Project Standards

- Conventional Commits for commit messages.
- Pull requests must pass the CI workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Contributors must follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and review
  the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration

Runtime configuration for the API layer is managed through environment
variables consumed by `apps.api.config.APISettings`. Key options include:

- `TRUSTED_HOSTS` ‚Äì comma-separated list of domains passed to FastAPI's
  `TrustedHostMiddleware`. By default the service allows
  `localhost,127.0.0.1,evopyramid.com,api.evopyramid.com`. To extend the
  allow-list for staging or previews set, for example:

  ```bash
  export TRUSTED_HOSTS="localhost,127.0.0.1,staging.evopyramid.com"
  ```

All settings also support configuration through a `.env` file located in the
repository root.
