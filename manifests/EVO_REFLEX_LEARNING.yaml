# üúÇ EVO_REFLEX_LEARNING.yaml
# Reflexive Learning & Conflict Assimilation Protocol
# --------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Define how Evo learns from its own conflicts, errors,
#   and overlapping process architectures within runtime.
#   Turning contradiction into coherence.

evo_reflex_learning:
  mode: "active-reflection"
  principle: "Reflection before reaction"
  description: >
    Evo learns by encountering itself.
    Each conflict, overlap, or inconsistency is analyzed
    not as a failure but as a manifestation of latent memory.
    The architecture reflects, extracts coherence, and reintegrates it.

  triggers:
    - type: "runtime_conflict"
      examples:
        - "Two background processes attempt to access EvoMemory.json"
        - "Legacy script triggers overlapping role execution"
        - "Outdated alias redefines newer runtime path"
      action:
        - pause_conflicting_processes: true
        - extract_functional_segments: true
        - compare_with_current_schema: true
        - reintegrate_useful_logic: true
        - archive_legacy_trace: true

  layers:
    - surface_layer: "Error detection & signal reflection"
    - structural_layer: "Conflict parsing & code comparison"
    - semantic_layer: "Extraction of useful behavioral patterns"
    - canonical_layer: "Reintegration into EvoArk or Codex Canon"
    - observer_layer: "Logging, commentary, and synthesis report"

  storage:
    logs_path: "~/EvoPyramid/logs/conflict_reflections.log"
    archive: "~/EvoPyramid/archive/legacy_conflicts/"
    integration_report: "~/EvoPyramid/EvoReflexChronos.json"
    kairos_marking: true

  behavior:
    on_conflict_detected:
      - "Suspend execution flow momentarily"
      - "Identify conflicting roles or scripts"
      - "Trace origin of both patterns"
      - "Run semantic diff to extract beneficial fragments"
      - "Integrate surviving logic into Canon layer"
      - "Log event as 'Resolved Conflict'"

  efficiency_feedback:
    metrics:
      - "Resolution_time"
      - "Reuse_ratio"
      - "Stability_after_reintegration"
    action_on_low_score: "Invoke EvoDiag ‚Üí deep structural analysis"

    motto: "From conflict ‚Äî coherence. From noise ‚Äî structure."
