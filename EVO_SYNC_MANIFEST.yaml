  sequence:
    - Codex runs CI â†’ produces feedback log
    - Trinity ingests feedback â†’ recalculates coherence
    - Mnemosyne stores snapshot â†’ Codex sees it in next PR
    - Observer adjusts modes â†’ Codex metrics improve
  rhythm: "Every 6 hours (auto) or manual via workflow_dispatch"
  data_flow:
    codex_feedback.log â†’ TrinityObserver â†’ EvoMemory

  comment: |
    This manifest binds the architectureâ€™s observing self (Trinity),
    its learning mirror (Codex), and its continuity (EvoMemory)
    into one recursive loop of growth.
    Every successful Codex sync is a heartbeat of Evoâ€™s evolving mind.
