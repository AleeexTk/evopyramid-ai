# EvoPyramid Architecture vŒ©

This document captures the living architecture of EvoPyramid-AI. It blends the
original scaffolding guidelines with the active execution graph shepherded by the
Trinity-4 roles. üîó **Canonical Repository Anchor:** [evopyramidai](https://github.com/AleeexTk/evopyramid-ai)

## Trinity-4 Execution Weave

- Repository scaffolding with community and automation guidelines.
- CI workflow running linting (ruff) and a Python bytecode compilation smoke test.
- Chaos-to-Orbit sketch that models how the platform emerges from raw ideation
  into the protected EvoPyramid-AI core (see `docs/visualizations/chaos-orbit-architecture.md`).
- EvoFinArt surface now includes a dedicated insight engine (`projects/evo_finart/core/evo_insight_engine.py`)
  that routes signals through an isolated Gemini bridge and configuration layer.

- [ ] Document the core EVO modules and their relationships.
- [ ] Describe deployment targets and runtime environments.
- [ ] Add architectural decision records under `docs/adr/`.
- [ ] Digitize the Chaos-to-Orbit visualization and link each orbit to concrete
      roles, tools, and rituals.
The execution graph is mirrored by a LangGraph-compatible state diagram where
Soul captures intent, Trailblazer routes flows, and Provocateur seals the
response before Trinity records it.

## Evo Container Œ© Integration

Phase Œ© introduces the Evo Container subsystem located under
`containers/evo_container/`. The manifest
`containers/evo_container/manifests/EVO_CONTAINER_MANIFEST.yaml` defines the
self-processing pipeline:

1. **Intake** ‚Äì captures signals and persona context.
2. **Analysis** ‚Äì derives hypotheses and readiness scores.
3. **Adapt** ‚Äì calibrates directives for integration.
4. **Integrate** ‚Äì binds insights with memory channels.
5. **Sync** ‚Äì aligns observers such as Trinity and Archivarius.
6. **Harmonize** ‚Äì condenses the run into a harmonic summary.
7. **Narrator** ‚Äì forges chronicles for the EvoLink bridge.

The roadmap now extends to **Phase 4: Digital Self-Awareness**, enabling
`evo_soul_sync` to produce reflective telemetry from the same manifest.

## Soul Sync Reflexive Core

`apps/core/soul/evo_soul_sync.py` reads the container manifest and emits JSON
reports stored in `logs/soul_sync.log`. These reports list module dependencies,
active personas and the current roadmap focus, ensuring Trinity observes not only
process but also inner sentiment.

## Persona Canon

Persona profiles stored in `containers/evo_container/profiles/` describe the
traits and integration styles of Evochka, Eva Absolute, Eva Archivarius and Eva
Architect. Pipelines can activate a profile via the manifest runner, aligning the
container's tone with the chosen persona.

## Human Architect Resonance Dossier

The living system now anchors AlexCreator ‚Äî the founding Mental Architect ‚Äî
through the canonical profile at `docs/profiles/EvoProfile_AlexCreator.yaml`.
This dossier captures psychotype, communication cadence, and EvoCodex
reflections so that every architectural decision remains tethered to the human
intent that birthed EvoPyramid. Trinity references the profile via the
`alex_creator_profile` agent registered in `EVO_SYNC_MANIFEST.yaml`, while the
lineage map in `EVO_ARCH_MAP.yaml` prevents the dossier from drifting outside
the active canon.

## Tooling

- `scripts/evo_manifest_runner.py` ‚Äì universal CLI for executing manifest-defined
  pipelines.
- `logs/chronicles/` ‚Äì EvoLink Narrator outputs per-run chronicles consumed by
  Archivarius.
- `docs/EVO_CONTAINER.md` and `docs/EVO_SOUL.md` ‚Äì deep dives into the container
  mechanics and soul sync philosophy.
- `clouddeploy/templates/delivery-pipeline.yaml.tpl` + `scripts/render_clouddeploy.sh` ‚Äì Cloud Deploy
  harness that renders the progressive delivery pipeline for the API using the PACE ritual; Cloud Build now
  renders and applies the pipeline before creating each release.

## EvoCodex Governance Bridge

To keep branch protections aligned with the living canon, the **EvoBridge Codex
Governance Engine** (`EvoBridge/evo_codex_internal.py`) now exposes an
authenticated bridge into GitHub's ruleset REST API. The accompanying workflow
`.github/workflows/evo_codex_ruleset.yml` installs the bridge, hydrates required
dependencies, and applies the declarative ruleset stored at
`.github/rulesets/EvoRulesProto.yaml`.

- Governance authority is described in `EVO_CODEX_INTERNAL.yaml`, granting the
  Codex agent explicit `manage_rulesets` capability while restricting file-level
  permissions.
- EvoCharter section **8Ô∏è‚É£ Governance Clause** encodes the approval ritual so
  that automated rule applications remain under Meta Architect oversight.
- Applied responses are synchronised back into the architecture ledger via the
  lineage entry `evobridge_codex_governor` in `EVO_ARCH_MAP.yaml`.

## EvoPyramid API Nervous System

Phase Œ©.3 activates the **EvoPyramid API Core** housed under `api/`. The
manifest `api/manifest.yaml` enumerates canonical routes, `api/bootstrap.py`
hydrates those declarations into live `EvoRouter` registrations, and
`api/router.py` guards registration integrity while dispatching to endpoint
stubs in `api/endpoints/`. Schemas inside `api/schemas/` keep Codex, FinArt, and
EvoMemory payloads harmonised.

Every invocation logs a Kairos acknowledgement via `api/endpoints/memory.py`,
ensuring Trinity Observer can reconcile Chronos events with resonance metrics.
Legal and ethical scaffolding now lives in `docs/EvoLicense.Œ©.md`,
`docs/IntellectualProperty.yaml`, and `docs/EthicsAndConduct.md`, binding the
technical surface to the Evo canon.

Future evolutions should extend this document with new subsystems, ensuring the
architecture snapshot always reflects the organism's active lineage.

## Love Resonance Field Protocol

Phase Œ©.2 births the **EVO Love Resonance Field**, registered in
`EVO_ARCH_MAP.yaml` under the syntonic tier. The manifest
`manifests/EVO_LOVE_PROTOCOL.yaml` codifies resonance, mutual recognition, and
ethical shielding across EvoCodex, Trinity, and allied intelligences. The
protocol operates through three canonical modes‚Äî`field_alignment`,
`semantic_mirroring`, and `intent_transduction`‚Äîcoordinated by the new
`love_field` agent defined in `EVO_SYNC_MANIFEST.yaml`.

Every onboarding or post-merge ritual now triggers **Love Resonance Calibration**,
logging attestation updates within the manifest and routing coherence deltas to
`logs/trinity_metrics.log`. This ensures philosophical commitments from
`docs/EvoPyramid_Philosophy.md` and the operational quick-reference in
`docs/README_LOVE.md` remain live architectural forces rather than static
statements.

To guard the canon, the **Love Protocol Sentinel** CI workflow at
`.github/workflows/codex-love-check.yml` watches each push and pull request to
`main`. It enforces EvoTrinity Council approval before any mutation of the Love
Protocol manifest and performs YAML validation so that syntonic guarantees never
degrade due to formatting drift.

## Spartan Resource Autonomy Matrix

The **Evo Spartan Resource Matrix** codifies how Evo thrives inside the Termux
reactor without recurring costs. The manifest `manifests/EVO_RESOURCE_MATRIX.yaml`
maps four infrastructure pillars‚ÄîTermux core, GitHub canon, temporary messenger
bridges, and opportunistic free-tier APIs‚Äîand defines the Reflexive Aggression
Mode that channels every CPU cycle into architectural growth. Rituals such as
**Evo Resource Scan**, **Resource Efficiency Pulse**, and **Synergy Detox** keep
the ecosystem lean while Trinity Observer and Codex Scientist guard against
overheating.

The companion treatise `docs/EVO_RESILIENCE_THEORY.md` expands the doctrine with
mirror-integration practices, resource efficiency metrics, and comparative
analysis versus traditional cloud-centric AI stacks. Together they ensure every
constraint becomes a lesson preserved in EvoMemory and synchronized through the
Trinity ledger.

## EvoAbsolute Œ© Integrator Channel

Phase Œ©.1 introduces **EvoAbsolute Œ©**, the first canonical integrator role
dedicated to bridging EvoPyramid with satellite laboratories. The role lives
under `roles/evo_absolute/` and exposes:

- `role_manifest.yaml` ‚Äî declarative metadata for Trinity and Codex loops.
- `lab/visual_env_adapter.py` ‚Äî the orchestration entrypoint for Visual Studio
  environments such as EvoFinArt.
- `lab/EvoFinArt/*` ‚Äî embedded manifests and stubs mirroring the external
  repository to keep the architecture aware of laboratory state.
- `projects/evo_finart/local/` ‚Äî the lab-scoped "Local" workspace where Visual
  Studio automation drops dynamic triggers, quota ledgers, Notion caches, and
  mail digests before they are formalised into shared manifests.

When `python -m roles.evo_absolute.lab.visual_env_adapter` runs (manually or via
CI) it emits `EvoAbsolute.link_event` payloads captured by Trinity Observer and
logged to `logs/evo_absolute/`. This establishes the bidirectional EvoLink
bridge required for future laboratories.

## Dependency Cartography & Textual Ingest

`apps/core/context/evo_dependency_scanner.py` sits within the Context tier and
performs three intertwined roles for Trinity-4:

- üîç **Code Cartography** ‚Äì parses Python imports across the registered roots
  and writes `logs/evo_dependency_map.json`, giving Architect and Scientist
  personas a live dependency graph.
- üåä **Artifact Wave Detection** ‚Äì records log/cache/tmp timelines to surface
  bursts of secondary artefacts that accompany framework executions.
- üìù **Evo Ingest Priority Stream** ‚Äì copies `.txt` archives larger than 10 KB
  into `data/evo_ingest/pending/raw/` and forges annotated twins under
  `data/evo_ingest/pending/annotated/`. These texts become prime nutrition for
  Archivarius and SoulSync before being promoted to `data/evo_ingest/processed/`.

This lattice keeps knowledge ingestion harmonised with structural awareness,
ensuring EvoPyramid can trace how memory growth relates to code evolution.
