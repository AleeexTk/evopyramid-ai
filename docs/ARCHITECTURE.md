# EvoPyramid-AI Architecture Overview

This document captures the evolving architecture of the EvoPyramid-AI platform.
It will grow alongside the codebase and should be updated whenever the
architecture changes.

## Current State

- Repository scaffolding with community and automation guidelines.
- CI workflow running linting (ruff) and a Python bytecode compilation smoke test.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Document the core EVO modules and their relationships.
- [ ] Describe deployment targets and runtime environments.
- [ ] Add architectural decision records under `docs/adr/`.

## Contributing to the Architecture Doc

When you introduce a new subsystem or significant dependency, update this file
with a short summary and diagrams where applicable.
