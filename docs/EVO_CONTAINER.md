# EVO Container Ω Guide

The EVO Container orchestrates a self-processing loop that converts raw
intents or external links into harmonized payloads. The loop executes
through seven lightweight stages with deterministic telemetry so that the
broader EvoPyramid surfaces can audit the state of each run.

## Stage Overview

1. **Intake** – `collect_link` timestamps the source payload and records the
   active profile. It seeds the shared state with insight breadcrumbs.
2. **Analysis** – `analyze_link` computes heuristic coherence and context
   relevance scores. These metrics are later surfaced in soul reflections.
3. **Adaptation** – `adapt_for_memory` aligns the payload with the operating
   mode defined by each profile. Guidance strings explain how the memory layer
   should treat the data.
4. **Integration** – `integrate_payload` prepares a structured message for the
   `memory.core` target and marks the preferred ingestion mode.
5. **Sync** – `sync_memory` registers the synchronization channel used by the
   narrator. This keeps Trinity informed about pending chronicles.
6. **Harmonize** – `harmonize_state` verifies component integrity, finalizes
   the coherence score and decides whether the payload is deployment ready.
7. **Narrate** – `create_chronicle` composes a narrative summary and writes a
   chronicle artifact under `logs/chronicles/`.

Each stage appends to the shared insight trail so that downstream tooling can
trace *why* a decision was made.

## Profiles

Profiles live under `containers/evo_container/profiles` and describe behavioral
modes:

- `evochka`: exploratory and emotionally tuned storytelling.
- `eva_absolute`: strategic, metrics-driven synthesis.
- `eva_archivarius`: archival focus preserving temporal fidelity.
- `eva_architect`: structural guidance for future design decisions.

## Manifest

The canonical manifest is stored at
`containers/evo_container/manifests/EVO_CONTAINER_MANIFEST.yaml`. It declares
modules, dependencies, the roadmap, and pipeline steps. The manifest is read by
`scripts/evo_manifest_runner.py` which provides a consistent interface across
Termux, desktop, and cloud environments.

## Running Pipelines

```bash
python scripts/evo_manifest_runner.py show-pipelines
python scripts/evo_manifest_runner.py run-pipeline link_import_to_memory \
  --link "https://chat.openai.com/share/example" --profile evochka
```

The runner emits the enriched pipeline state in JSON, including references to
chronicle artifacts generated by the narrator.
# EVO Container Ω

Evo Container Ω orchestrates the self-processing loop that guides how EvoPyramid
assimilates external knowledge. The container exposes modular stages—intake,
analysis, adaptation, integration, synchronisation, harmonisation—and binds them
to the EvoLink Narrator for chronicle generation.

## Module Topology

| Stage | Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Signal Intake | `containers/evo_container/intake.py` | Capture raw payloads and persona context. |
| Analytical Weave | `containers/evo_container/analysis.py` | Derive hypotheses from the captured signal. |
| Adaptive Calibration | `containers/evo_container/adapt.py` | Translate insights into actionable directives. |
| Integrative Synthesis | `containers/evo_container/integrate.py` | Blend directives with memory channels. |
| Observer Sync | `containers/evo_container/syncer.py` | Align observers such as Trinity or Archivarius. |
| Harmonic Closure | `containers/evo_container/harmonize.py` | Produce a unified summary for downstream rituals. |
| Narrative Bridge | `containers/evo_container/evo_link_bridge/narrator/processor.py` | Convert timelines into Evo chronicles. |

## Manifest

The container is driven by `containers/evo_container/manifests/EVO_CONTAINER_MANIFEST.yaml`.
It lists available modules and the pipelines composing them. Phase 4 of the
roadmap activates the `evo_soul_sync` module, allowing the Soul Sync engine to
report the system's reflective state.

## Personas

Canonical persona profiles reside in `containers/evo_container/profiles/`:

- `evochka.yaml`
- `eva_absolute.yaml`
- `eva_archivarius.yaml`
- `eva_architect.yaml`

Each profile defines archetype, traits, and preferred integration protocols. The
runner can surface these traits when harmonising outputs.

## Running Pipelines

Use the universal runner:

```bash
python scripts/evo_manifest_runner.py run-pipeline link_import_to_memory --link "https://example" --profile evochka
```

The command emits a JSON snapshot of the execution context and writes a chronicle
under `logs/chronicles/`.

## Chronicle Output

Chronicles are stored as timestamped text files containing the formatted
timeline. These artefacts are consumed by Archivarius and Trinity observers to
trace how the container transformed the initial input into a harmonised state.
