# Quantum Context Engine Integration Report

## Completed Work

- **Architecture**
  - `apps/core/context/quantum_analyzer.py` – asynchronous multi-layer context analysis.
  - `apps/core/memory/pyramid_memory.py` – hierarchical XML-backed memory model.
  - `apps/core/integration/context_engine.py` – orchestrator tying analysis and memory.
- **Testing**
  - `tests/context/test_quantum_analyzer.py`
  - `tests/context/test_pyramid_memory.py`
- **Documentation**
  - `docs/integration/QUANTUM_CONTEXT_INTEGRATION.md`
  - `docs/integration/API_REFERENCE.md`
- **Tooling & Examples**
  - `scripts/setup_context_engine.sh`
  - `examples/context_engine_demo.py`
  - `requirements_context.txt`

## Highlights

- Parallel asynchronous analysis combining intent, affect, and memory signals.
- Priority pipelines (`AGI`, `SOUL`, `ROLE`, `HYBRID`) provide adaptive responses.
- Pyramid memory delivers relevance-scored fragments across multiple knowledge layers.
- Integration engine tracks performance statistics and exposes a simplified API.

## Next Steps

1. Integrate the `enhanced_respond` helper within EvoCodex workflows.
2. Populate PyramidMemory with domain-specific fragments.
3. Tune thresholds and weights for production workloads.
4. Extend the engine with ML-driven relevance scoring and visualisation tools.

The Quantum Context Engine is ready for deployment within EvoCodex.
